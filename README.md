For this MERN Stack project I have created a finance/expense tracker. it can calculate your total balance based on income and expenses and the data that is inputed like purchases or deposits for each transaction are all connected to mongo db. I called the app Fries bank and have created four pages, and have tried my hardest to meet all the requirments. I have experianced many errors and when trying to fix them A problem occured that the individual prices for the transactions would not show, but the whole app works amazing.this app can record transactions, view transactions, calculate the balance, and add new transactions.
